    <string name="about_us">Jivanmukta derived from the Sanskrit words \'Jiva\' (soul) and \'Mukti\' (liberation) Just like the body changes clothes everyday, the soul takes new bodies every birth. The divine aspect of the soul is in its immortality, timelessness, self-knowledge as well as the ability to experience itself, both as dual and non-dual. Spirituality is not something that needs to be pursued only when we get ?old? or we having nothing \'better\' to do. It is the only way of life. \n\n

Tulasidas said "Binu satsang viveka nahin Rama kripa binu satsang naahi....." With this firm faith, our journey started in 1981. Through the last 3 decades it has spread its wings across the world. Param Pujya Gurudev who has not only championed learning of a variety of scriptures but have inspired to live that knowledge. One who has firmly advocated that the knowledge has to transpire into living. Gurudev talks the walk. His teachings are through his living. The talks and writings are merely a reflection of the living. A role model and inspiration who magnetically attracts all who come across by his expression of love. Once experienced it is yearned for? This website is an expression of such love. An open invitation to all to experience this. \n\n

Our Satsang started 35 years ago and over the last decade has grown into a truly global Satsang. 
Please write to us at Jivanmuktas.global@gmail.com\n\n\n</string>

    <string name="hometext">
        Param Pujya Guruji says actions need to follow knowledge.
        suna-mana-KIYA-toh jana. The emphasis is on \"KIYA\" (ACTION)!\n\nVivekachoodamani says increasing the desire to do good to others is the only way to liberation.\n\nGuru Seva for a week a year provides the opportunity to do good to others.
        At just 2% of the year we can start a new habit.\nThis new habit will help achieve all the Satsang goals across Nivritti, Gita Distribution and Workshops. Let us do it.\n

        <item>6. Is​ ​it​ ​only​ ​teaching​ ​academics​ ​that​ ​can​ ​be​ ​done​ ​at​ ​Nivritti​ ​Gurukul?</item>

        <item>8. How​ ​difficult​ ​it​ ​is​ ​to​ ​adjust​ ​in​ ​Nivritti​ ​–​ ​are​ ​there​ ​any​ ​infrastructure​ ​issues?</item>
        <item>9. I​ ​have​ ​small​ ​children​ ​-​ ​can​ ​I​ ​take​ ​them​ ​along? </item>
        <item>10. Are there any list of instructions given to volunteers before they reach Gurukula? </item>
        <item>11.​ ​When​ ​should​ ​I​ ​fill​ ​in​ ​the​ ​volunteer​ ​availability​ ​form? </item>
    </string-array>


    <string-array name="faqans">
        <item>The minimum timespan is seven days including travel time. You can volunteer for moreif you wish.</item>
        <item>You do. Travel cost to Nivritti Gurukul one way from various points given below:\n
            ● Mangalore airport INR 1800 (at times parking charges needs to be pe paid extra)\n
            ● Mangalore Railway station INR 1800\n
            ● Udupi Railway station INR [500]\n
            There is no other cost to be incurred by you since stay and food is at Nivritti.\n</item>

        <item>There are at least five visiting volunteers required every day of the week, in addition to
                the resident volunteers. Reduction to these numbers results in untoward pressure on
                Param Pujya Guruji, which we all want to avoid.
                Param Pujya Guruji, is there for 12 hours a day and seven days a week – no break!! He
                takes three hours of satsangh plus also academic/music sessions for students. Surely
                none of us would want him to take such load and hence visiting volunteers are absolutely required.</item>

        <item>This rarely happens when there are late additions to volunteers exceeding daily
            requirements. Generally, in most other parts of the year the numbers have remained
            below optimal requirement of five per day. This means there is added pressure on
            Param Pujya Guruji and the few resident volunteers.\n
            Every week a list is published in the Good News mail with number of volunteers
            required from Jan 1 to May 30 to make up the five every day. You will see from that list
            that many days there are zero volunteers!!</item>

        <item>Param Pujya Guruji has advised that Nivritti takes priority in terms of Guru Seva during
            the current year. If you can do Gita Distribution / workshops and Nivritti; good! Else
            prioritise seva at Nivritti.</item>

        <item>Teaching is the primary job so at any given time we do need three of the five volunteers
                who can do some degree of teaching. Having said that if you cannot teach at all then
                there are other jobs that can be done like teaching musical instruments, bhajans, routine
                admin jobs of minding the store supplies, Library management, looking after the girls (if
                you are lady), serving the food, getting ready for aarti, saying grace etc – all small jobs
                individually but these add up.</item>

        <item>The subjects are very simple and the material is made available to you in advance of
                your visits. The technical subjects like accountancy and economics can be taught only by
                certain people with prior knowledge but certainly history, sociology and English can be
                taught by almost anyone who is willing to prepare a little bit.</item>
        <item>There are no issues – perhaps minor inconvenience for some. If you can adjust to Indian
            toilets and sleeping with beds on the floor, then the infrastructure is excellent.</item>

        <item>Given the location and conditions, only children above the age of 15 are encouraged to
                be brought along to the Gurukul. If you have smaller children then volunteer for offsite seva.</item>

        <item>Yes….there is an instruction manual circulated to all visiting volunteers</item>
        <item>Immediately once you mail/whatsapp your dates/confirm on phone</item>
